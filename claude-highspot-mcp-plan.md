## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Claude Desktop Integration
- **Document Analysis**: Analyzes uploaded intake documents directly in Claude Desktop
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Parses tables, headers, and content sections from documents
- **User Interaction**: Provides interactive confirmation of extracted content
- **Tool Invocation**: Calls MCP Server endpoints to execute Highspot operations

### 2.2 MCP Server
- **API Gateway**: Exposes endpoints for Claude Desktop to call
- **Authentication Management**: Securely stores and uses Highspot API credentials
- **Content Processing**: Transforms Claude's output into Highspot-compatible formats
- **Task Orchestration**: Manages the sequence of API calls needed for complex operations

### 2.3 Highspot Integration
- **Content Creation**: Creates spots, pages and content in Highspot
- **Permission Management**: Sets correct visibility and sharing options
- **Asset Organization**: Structures content according to templates
- **Draft Publishing**: Creates drafts for peer review

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Claude Desktop Workflow
1. Upload intake document to Claude Desktop conversation
2. Claude analyzes document structure and extracts requirements
3. Claude confirms extracted information with you
4. Claude invokes MCP Server endpoints via tool calls
5. Claude reports back status and provides link to draft content

### 3.2 MCP Server Endpoints
- **/authenticate**: Establish session with Highspot
- **/create-spot**: Create new spot or access existing one
- **/create-page**: Add page to a spot
- **/add-content**: Add specific content to a page
- **/set-permissions**: Configure sharing and visibility
- **/publish-draft**: Finalize draft and notify reviewers
- **/status**: Check status of content creation process

### 3.3 Data Flow
1. **Document → Structured Data**: Claude extracts form fields into structured format
2. **Structured Data → API Calls**: MCP Server transforms data into Highspot API payloads
3. **API Response → Status Updates**: Results from Highspot are relayed back to Claude

## 4. Development Phases

### Phase 1: MCP Server Development (2-3 weeks)
- Set up basic server infrastructure
- Implement Highspot API authentication
- Create core endpoints for content operations
- Build error handling and logging

### Phase 2: Claude Desktop Integration (1-2 weeks)
- Design document parsing prompts
- Create confirmation dialogues
- Implement tool calling patterns
- Build status reporting

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement (1-2 weeks)
- Test with various intake document formats
- Refine error handling
- Optimize response times
- Add advanced features

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 MCP Server Requirements
- **Server Environment**: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI
- **Hosting**: Cloud service with API accessibility
- **Security**: HTTPS, API key management, request validation
- **Logging**: Comprehensive operation logging for troubleshooting

### 5.2 API Implementation
- RESTful endpoints with JSON payloads
- Authentication token management
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Async operations for long-running tasks

### 5.3 Claude Desktop Integration
- Tool definition for MCP server access
- Document processing prompts
- Status monitoring capabilities
- Error recovery procedures

## 6. Workflow Example

### 6.1 User Perspective
1. Upload intake document to Claude Desktop
2. Claude: "I've analyzed your Highspot intake form. Here's what I found..."
3. Claude: "Confirming: You want to create a spot titled 'ABM Centre of Excellence' with sections for 'Build Your Strategy' and 'Build Your Tactics'?"
4. User: "Yes, that's correct"
5. Claude: "I'm now creating this in Highspot... [processing]"
6. Claude: "Draft created successfully! Your peer [name] has been notified for review. You can view the draft here: [link]"

### 6.2 Technical Perspective
1. Document parsed into structured data object
2. MCP Server authenticates with Highspot
3. Create spot with basic metadata
4. Add sections based on template
5. Add content elements to each section
6. Set permissions as specified
7. Publish as draft and trigger notifications
8. Return status and links to Claude Desktop

## 7. Notification System

### 7.1 Peer Review Notifications
- Email notifications to designated reviewers
- Inclusion of direct links to draft content
- Deadline information from intake form
- Clear review instructions

### 7.2 Status Updates
- Completion notifications to content owner
- Error alerts if issues occur
- Review status tracking
- Publication confirmations

## 8. Advanced Features (Future Phases)

### 8.1 Content Enhancement
- AI-generated content suggestions
- Image recommendations
- SEO optimization
- Content consistency checking

### 8.2 Workflow Improvements
- Revision tracking
- Approval workflows
- Performance analytics
- Content effectiveness metrics

## 9. Security Considerations

### 9.1 Authentication
- Secure API key storage
- Token-based authentication
- Credential rotation policy
- Access logging

### 9.2 Data Protection
- Secure transmission protocols
- Content validation
- Minimal data retention
- Compliance with security policies
